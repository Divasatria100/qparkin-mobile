   - Each floor shows its name (e.g., "Lantai 1", "Lantai 2")
   - Available slot count is displayed in real-time

### Step 4: View Slot Availability (NEW!)

After selecting a floor, you'll see a visual representation of parking slots:

**Slot Visualization:**
- **Grid Layout:** Slots are displayed in a grid showing their positions
- **Color Coding:**
  - 🟢 **Green:** Available slots you can reserve
  - ⚫ **Grey:** Occupied slots (currently in use)

**Slot Information:**

**How Random Slot Reservation Works:**

1. After viewing slot availability, tap the **"Pesan Slot Acak di [Nama Lantai]"** button

- The system will notify you: "Tidak ada slot tersedia di lantai ini"

- Try selecting a different floor
- Or wait a few minutes and try again
